# SketchUp-Make
SketchUp Make was the free version of SketchUp before they introduced Web only free SketchUp.

SketchUp Make was the free offline version of 3D modeling software SketchUp lineup before they've introduced all web version SketchUp Free.

Right before SketchUp have pulled their free versions from their website I've managed to grab a copy.

=== 2016 and 2017 versions of SketchUp Make, Mac and Win 

*** 2016 is the last SketchUp Make version to support 32 bit Windows (useful for Atom Win10 tablets which can only do 32bit Win) ***
